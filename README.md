# AI Mind Palace

### Your second brain – powered by Agentic AI and memory management

AI Mind Palace is an experimental **personal AI memory system**.
It combines **chat** with a **structured memory architecture**:

- **Vector memory** for semantic recall.
- **Database memory** for people, decisions, and project/task management.
- **Multi-chat support**: multiple conversations share the same memory (both vector + DB).
- **User authentication** with [Clerk](https://clerk.com).

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💬 **Chat** with an AI agent.
- 🧠 **Manage memory**:

  1. Vector memory (FAISS) – store and retrieve knowledge.
  2. Database memory – structured tracking of people, decisions, and projects/tasks.

- 🔑 **Authentication** via Clerk.
- 📂 **Multiple chat threads** with **shared memory** (beyond per-conversation history).
